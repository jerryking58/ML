ML

This is a package that implements kinds of machine learning algorithms when studying machine learning. First of all, algorithms described in [Statistical learning methods](http://baike.baidu.com/view/8414646.htm?fr=aladdin) are implemented. Then I'm trying to read [Machine Learning](http://www.amazon.com/Machine-Learning-Tom-M-Mitchell/dp/0070428077/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1411125657&sr=8-4&keywords=machine+learning) written by Tom  and implement some algorithms not inlcuded in the book above.
